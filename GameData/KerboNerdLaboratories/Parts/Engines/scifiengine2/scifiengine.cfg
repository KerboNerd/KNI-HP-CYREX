	description = CYREX is the biggest and the baddest propulsion system ever invented... for now... The aggressive particle bombardement of HyperPlutonium makes this engine the top pick for interstellar travel! Using smart nano-filters, it can operate it's Fission Reactor in atmospheres without causing exhaust radiation! Just make sure to bring some EC generators, cause you're gonna run out of EC pretty quick!
